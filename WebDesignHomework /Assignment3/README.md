# Assignment 3

So far, it has been **difficult** to navigate all the different programs we are using and how they interact and which ones are for that specific purpose. Each of the programs:

1. [Canvas](https://canvas.umt.edu/courses/8588/assignments/184273?module_item_id=953797)
2. [External Course Website](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/webDesignFall2024//topic-02/markdown-links/#)
3. [GitHub](https://github.com)
4. [Visual Studio Code]

At the end of each lesson and assignment, once I have *finally* got my ducks in a row and feel I have *maybe* figured it out I feel a bit better but then to go back and do it again, it doesn't feel fresh. Suppose I'm just struggling with the streamline of it all and am attempting figure out how to remember the purpose of each thing I do. But I hope it all makes more sense soon, I think it is starting to.
