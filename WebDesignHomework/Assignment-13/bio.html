    <p><b>Orion Bos</b> (b. 1999, he/him) is an artist and printmaker currently living and working in Eugene, Oregon. Born and raised in the Rocky Mountains of rural Montana, he is influenced by elements and relationships present in the rugged and ever-changing landscapes and ecosystems of home. In 2024, he received his BFA from the University of Montana where he collaborated with several visiting artists through Matrix Press in the creation of sizeable and varying editions of prints. Bos also has work in the Montana Museum of Art and Cultureâ€™s permanent collection and has exhibited his work around Montana and Washington.</p>

    <h1 id="h1">Statement</h1>
    <p>My work interprets the psychological and physiological effects of trauma through a queer ecological lens. The invasive and parasitic flora stemming from human forms suggests a corruption in the ecosystem of self and garden of memory. My overgrown and grafted anatomies visualize a cycle of transfigurement to who, how, and what we are as a result of trauma being treated like a noxious weed. The bilateral symmetry alludes to the Rorschach inkblot tests and their association with trauma and memory to initiate a self-projective dialogue with the viewer.</p>
    <p>I see the print as kin to the carving, a literal reflection of its ancestor and an inheritor of its patterns. The notion of trauma as an heirloom has led me to the continual manipulation and distortion of prints through material and form as a way to explore evolution, autonomy, and the ends and beginnings of generational cycles.</p>
