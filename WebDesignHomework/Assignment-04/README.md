1. A web browser functions by retrieving and accessing all the code like HTML and JavaScript that will render the website. It positions and organizes all the elements where they need to go to display the webpage. 

2. The DOM basically stylizes and "decorates" a website by untangling the tree structure of a website. It provides interfacing and modification to the elements of that that webpage by designing it and linking that design to the actual file structure of the site depending on the browser being used to access it. 

3. HTML is "Hypertext Markup Language" and is the most used and understood markup language. XML is "Extensible Markup Language" came after HTML and functions a bit differently. XHTML is "Extensible Hypertext Markup Language" and is the child of HTML and XML combined. The main difference that I gathered between HTML and XML is that HTML visually displays the elements of the document and XML describes those same elements. XHTML displays the elements but also uses XML to fill in the rest or to aid in the generation of the site.

4. The purpose of the index.html file is like a README.md file though it categorizes and literally indexes the pages of the site so that information, pages, files, and more can be searched for and found. It further strengthens the hierarchy of the site. This file should be placed at the root level.

5. Document type, the Root, Head, and Body. In that order. The head comes first and explains how the body should be oriented.
