<h3> Designate which page you're working on this week</h3>
<p>I will be working on my page from last week's assignment: Weeds. I am going to move all of my head styling from each of my subpages to the CSS file and try and simplify each pages styles attributes.</p>
<br />
<h4> Required Techniques (Must Have): </h4>
<br />
<ul>
    <li> I created a subfolder named STYLE with a page for my CSS styling. This page holds all the styling for all of my pages on my site: navigation bar styling and functions, as well as text colors and such.</li>
<br />
    <li> I've been using class selectors to make my navigation bar. I have a estimated total of at least 20 class selectors.</li>
<br />
    <li> My use of ID selector is present in my navigation bar aswell. A lot went into it to get it functional with the dropdowns. I also used an ID selector to change the color of font on a specific page for captions. My "Are Weeds Friends or Foes?" page has a caption that clarifies what my embedded iframes are for but in a different color than the rest of the text.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<h4> Select at Least Three Additional Techniques:</h4>
<br />
<ul>
    <li>I changed the background color of my navigation bar. I don't really want to change background colors of other parts of the site, as I really enjoy the simple black and white nature of it--very readable and the start contrast is just appealing to my own eyes. But I did change the background color of two entire pages that I am not finished building to be a light coral red color. This was to show that the pages aren't finished yet; these incomplete pages also have text on them stating that they are not complete and to check back later. </li>
    <br />
    <li>A different font color I used was light gray on secondary information within lists. The title of the second of each list is black and is a heading, while the listed information below it is light gray. I did this to create some clarity and simplify the readability. I also changed font colors of links. I really hate the bright blue color hyperlinks change to when linking to another page, so I got rid of the underline that accompanies them and made the text black so that it fits the aesthetic of the rest of the site. There are two times that I left the blue color which were meant to stand out and take you to an external source rather than to one of my local pages.</li>
    <br />
    <li>I used opacity to affect my navigation bar at the top of the site. When I changed the background color of the nav bar to white smoke, I didn't like how it really just looked like a block at the top, and so I made it fade a bit and that helped integrate the color change into the site better. More aesthetically pleasing.</li>
    <br />
    <li>Oh god, text alignment is great and all and then it is not. I've used text alignment on almost everything but it really frustrates me because sometimes it works and other times it doesn't. I know that this is an error on my part somewhere in the muck of the site, and probably comes down to importance of styling info. But I've made my way with it. Text alignment has been used to center my lists, certain images. I primarily use "text-align: center" but have also begun to use the "justify" effect as well. Just got to be about margins and positioning with it.</li>
</ul>
