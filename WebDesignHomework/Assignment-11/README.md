<h1><b>WEEDS</b>, I have affected all of my pages, including my navigation bar for this assignment.</h1>
<br /> 
<p>I am further developing my page <b>"WEEDS"</b> from previous weeks 9 and 10.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Required Techniques (Must Have):</h3>
<br />
<ul>
    <li>My CSS Stylesheet is external for my entire site.</li>
    <li>I've added a hover effect to my links as well as elements in my navigation bar. Links within paragraphs are black, but when hovered over they become italic and their color changes to light coral. I did not set a "visited" change to the links, as I don't like having that extra color.</li>
    <li>My self-hosted font-family is: <i>Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif.</i> It is used on my pages "Native Species" and "Noxious Species" under "Identification".</li>
    <li>I used an external font from Google Fonts for most of the site. Font is: "Urbanist, sans-serif". I like the clean, minimalist look of this font. It is easy to read. I adjusted the letter-spacing to make it a bit more readable.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<h3>Select at Least Three Additional Techniques:</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>I adjusted the font weight on my index.html page: "What is a weed?" to be lighter than the automatic weight. I also applied this to certain paragraphs, to make them fit the aesthetic better and not make the site look to chunky.</li>
<li>I used text-decoration to remove underlines from links within paragraphs to external sites, as well as internal pages. The underline just makes things look too blocky, but to ensure the link is still noticeable, I made become italic and change color when hovered over.</li>
<li>I used pseudo classes to make a link visible, but it doesn't change color after it's been visited.</li>
</ul>
