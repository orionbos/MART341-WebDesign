<br />
<p style="color: black; padding-left: 20%; padding-right: 20%; text-align: justify;"><b>Orion Bos</b> <i>(b. 1999, he/him)</i> is an artist and printmaker currently living and working in Eugene, Oregon. Born and raised in the Rocky Mountains of rural Montana, he is influenced by elements of the rugged, everchanging landscapes and ecosystems of home. Bos’ work interprets trauma, familial dynamics, and identity through a visual vocabulary of sticks and stones, flora and fauna, and the human figure to draw representative comparisons between the human psyche and the environment. In 2024, he received his BFA from the University of Montana where he collaborated with several visiting artists through Matrix Press in the creation of sizeable and varying editions of prints. Bos also has work in the Montana Museum of Art and Culture’s permanent collection.</p>
