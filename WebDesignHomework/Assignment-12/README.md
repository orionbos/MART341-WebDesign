<h1>Assignment-12 README</h1>
<p>I made a new site--or rather, I remade my original site from assignment 8.</p>

<h3>Select at least 6 of the following techniques to implement:</h3>
<br />
<br />
<ul>
    <li><b>Sizing</b> – I played around with sizing on text. Different title headers needed to be different sizes to fit correctly.</li>
    <br />
    <li><b>Overflow</b> – I used overflow to make sure that when the screen is stretched or moved around, that the icons and such would not just disappear.</li>
    <br />
    <li><b>Border</b> – I didn't use border.</li>
    <br />
    <li><b>Margin</b> – I used margin on almost everything. To make headings and icons/logos fit correctly. I also used it on paragraphs to make sure they look aesthetically nice.</li>
    <br />
    <li><b>Padding</b> – I also did a lot of padding especially on text because when you adjust font style for links, if the margin isn't right, it will cut off the edge of the affected text. Padding made it so it didn't get cut off but still was able to become italicized.</li>
    <br />
    <li><b>Display: Inline / Inline-block</b> – I used inline and inline-blocks to make my landing page header, as well as all the lists. I used lists in a different way this time and made them my menus. I also used display to control images and their placement.</li>
    <br />
    <li><b>Dropdown</b> – I've already made a few drop downs on the other pages and I wanted to try something a little more stylized and funky. So, instead of a dropdown, I made lists that link to specific pages with more lists. I like the boldness of it and I think getting rid of the navigation bar kind of gave the site a more integrated experience.</li>
    <br />
    <li><b>Position</b> – I used position for my background images, as well as headings and such. I used fixed and relative to make things scroll and move around nicely.</li>
</ul>
