<h1>Technique I Used This Week</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Divs</h2>
<ol>
    <li>For my first Div, I used the element to group my Navigation bar at the top of the site and create dropdown menus, i.e.: Selected Prints, Sculpture within the Portfolio tab. I also did this on my About dropdown with my Biography and Statement page, CV page, and my new page: What is a Print?.</li>
    <li>I also used the Div element to center  media and text on my new page. So that the iframe, its caption of credit, and the following paragraph are also centered.</li>
</ol>
<br />

<h2>Spans</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> One of my uses of the span attribute was for placing my credit caption beneath my iframe. I styled the text to be smaller, light grey, and to be directly beneath the video within the iframe. I did this so it doesn't draw to much attention but also provides the necessary credits to the media's author.</li>
    </ul>
<br />

<h2>Audio</h2>
    <p>For my use of audio, I used the iframe element to import 2 podcasts from Soundcloud that relate to my content. I adjusted their scale to and centering to fit the page nicely.</p>

<br />

<h2>Video</h2>
    <p>For video, I used the iframe element at the top of the page to import a youtube video related to my content, but I also imported a personal video in my process section using the video tags. This video was placed in my images folder and then referenced and styled to fit amongst the other process images.</p>

<br />

<h2>iframe</h2>
    <p>My use of the <i>iframe</i> element on my new page is a <b>Creative Commons</b> Youtube video that demonstrates the woodcut printmaking method from start to finish. I placed the iframe video in the center of the page above a paragraph that also describes the process.</p>

<br />

<h2>Class</h2>
 <ol>
        <li>I have used the class attribute to build my navigation bar and its functions including the drop down menus within the section links to other pages. This allowed me to apply specific functions like the way in which the menu drops down when you hover your cursor above it and how the button changes colors when hovered over. </li>
        <li>I also used the class attribute to determine my media container on my new page.</li>
    </ol>
<br />

<h2>Escape Character</h2>
    <p>My use of Escape characters was to use quotation marks. I did this on my new page: &#34;What is a Print?&#34; in my About dropdown menu in the navigation bar. I used the quoatation escape character to specify words that some people might not understand, which I then explain and give context and definition to. </p>
