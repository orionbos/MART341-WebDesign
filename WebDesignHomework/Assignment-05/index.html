<h1>Website Ideas</h1>
<br />  
<h2>Portfolio</h2>
<p>As an artist, a website is incredibly important. It functions as many things: as an archive, a way for people to find and contact you, as well as many other things. I do currently have a website that I created using Squarespace but I would love to be able to customize my own and really make it mine. The vibe would be professional, clean, simple.</p>

<br />
<h2>Archive/Blog</h2>
<p>Another idea is--and this is niche and for my own personal use--to create an archive website that has pages that contain images and facts about plants that I use in my art practice. I currently use a notebook and field guides but it's difficult having to flip from page to page to try and find what I am looking for. So this site would be an archive of plant species that would be indexed and organized through tags and traits and images. I would be able to search a key term or something like that and it would take me to that plant. It would be very simple and clean, professional but not flashy or super stylized. A notebook for me.</p>
<br />
<h2>Market/Shop</h2>
<p>This site would be in tandem with the first site, the portfolio. Its intent would be an external market/shop for artworks that I am selling. Squarespace takes a percentage when selling things, so creating an external site would allow me to take back control. It would be clean and simple and would function as second step from the first site. Very professional and informational.</p>
