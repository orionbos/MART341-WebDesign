<h1>Why I Chose These Ideas</h1>
<br />
<h2>Portfolio</h2>
<p>I am an artist and a website to host images and information about me and my art/practice is extremely important. It's how people contact me, find me, buy art from me.</p>
<br />
<h2>Archive/Blog</h2>
<p> My art is very research based on invasive plant species. Because of this, I spend a lot of time bookmarking and going through field guides, plant books, and so on. I have many and each is used for different things. An archive site like this would allow me to consolidate and organize images, information, and more in a way that I could easily search for what I am after.</p>
<br />
<h2>Marketplace/Shop</h2>
<p>As an artist, if I want to keep being one, I must sell art. I currently use Squarespace, but if I create my own website outside of Squarespace I would need to host a marketplace for it too. This would be beneficial to me because Squarespace wouldn't be profiting off of my sales.</p>
